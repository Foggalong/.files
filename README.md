dot-files
=========
A collection of my .files for various programs.


Bashrc
======
There's not much difference between the default file and this one, it's mainly here to back up my alieses and functions.


Conky
=====
An original conky configuration file. It originally started as the one that comes default with #!10 but they have next to nothing in common now. The idea is that it starts in a bar at the top of the screen where the title bar of the windows normally go.

It's specifically configured for my 1280x1024 monitor and so to get it working at other resolutions will require changing all the ${goto 170} numbers accordingly. It's also configured to say that any wired network it connects to is called HORNET, so just change that to a name of your liking. The colour change to indicate a resource is running at a "dangerous level" happens at 80% for all but this can easily be changed to your suiting.

Because the two output lines are incredibly long (no newlines as to keep the bar shape) I can put a part by part breakdown if required. Just file an issue and I'll get around to it.
